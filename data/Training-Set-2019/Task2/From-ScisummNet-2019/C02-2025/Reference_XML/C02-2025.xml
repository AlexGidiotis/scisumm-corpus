			<S sid="1" ssid="1">For the past decade or more, symbolic, linguistically oriented methods and statistical or machine learning approaches to NLP have often been perceived as incompat ible or even competing paradigms.</S>
			<S sid="2" ssid="2">While shallow andprobabilistic processing techniques have produced use ful results in many classes of applications, they have not met the full range of needs for NLP, particularly where precise interpretation is important, or where the variety of linguistic expression is large relative to the amount of training data available.</S>
			<S sid="3" ssid="3">On the other hand, deep approaches to NLP have only recently achieved broad enough grammatical coverage and sufficient processing efficiency to allow the use of precise linguistic grammars in certain types of real-world applications.In particular, applications of broad-coverage analyti cal grammars for parsing or generation require the use ofsophisticated statistical techniques for resolving ambiguities; the transfer of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) systems into industry, for example, has amplified the need for general parse ranking, disambigua tion, and robust recovery techniques.</S>
			<S sid="4" ssid="4">We observe generalconsensus on the necessity for bridging activities, com bining symbolic and stochastic approaches to NLP.</S>
			<S sid="5" ssid="5">Butalthough we find promising research in stochastic parsing in a number of frameworks, there is a lack of appro priately rich and dynamic language corpora for HPSG.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Likewise, stochastic parsing has so far been focussed on information-extraction-type applications and lacks anydepth of semantic interpretation.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">The Redwoods initia tive is designed to fill in this gap.</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">In the next section, we present some of the motivationfor the LinGO Redwoods project as a treebank develop ment process.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">Although construction of the treebank isin its early stages, we present in Section 3 some prelim inary results of using the treebank data already acquired on concrete applications.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">We show, for instance, that even simple statistical models of parse ranking trained on the Redwoods corpus built so far can disambiguate parses with close to 80% accuracy.</S>

	<SECTION title="A Rich and Dynamic Treebank" number="2">
			<S sid="11" ssid="1">The Redwoods treebank is based on open-source HPSGresources developed by a broad consortium of re search groups including researchers at Stanford (USA), Saarbru?cken (Germany), Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Sussex (UK), and Tokyo (Japan).</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="2">Their wide distribution and common acceptance make the HPSG framework and resources an excellent anchor point for the Redwoods treebanking initiative.The key innovative aspect of the Redwoods approach to treebanking is the anchoring of all linguistic data captured in the treebank to the HPSG framework and a generally-available broad-coverage gram mar of English, the LinGO English Resource Grammar(Flickinger, 2000) as implemented with the LKB grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002).</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="3">Un like existing treebanks, there is no need to define a (new)form of grammatical representation specific to the treebank.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="4">Instead, the treebank records complete syntactosemantic analyses as defined by the LinGO ERG and provide tools to extract different types of linguistic informa tion at varying granularity.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="5">The treebanking environment, building on the [incr tsdb()] profiling environment (Oepen &amp; Callmeier, 2000), presents annotators, one sentence at a time, with the full set of analyses produced by the grammar.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="6">Using a pre-existing tree comparison tool in the LKB (similar in kind to the SRI Cambridge TreeBanker; Carter, 1997),annotators can quickly navigate through the parse for est and identify the correct or preferred analysis in thecurrent context (or, in rare cases, reject all analyses pro posed by the grammar).</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="7">The tree selection tool presentsusers, who need little expert knowledge of the underlying grammar, with a range of basic properties that distin guish competing analyses and that are relatively easy to judge.</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="8">All disambiguating decisions made by annotators are recorded in the [incr tsdb()] database and thus becomeavailable for (i) later dynamic extraction from the annotated profile or (ii) dynamic propagation into a more re cent profile obtained from re-running a newer version of the grammar on the same corpus.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="9">Important innovative research aspects in this approach to treebanking are (i) enabling users of the treebank toextract information of the type they need and to trans form the available representation into a form suited to their needs and (ii) the ability to update the treebank with an enhanced version of the grammar in an automated fashion, viz.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="10">by re-applying the disambiguating decisions on the corpus with an updated version of the grammar.Depth of Representation and Transformation of In formation Internally, the [incr tsdb()] database recordsanalyses in three different formats, viz.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="11">(i) as a derivation tree composed of identifiers of lexical items and con structions used to build the analysis, (ii) as a traditional phrase structure tree labeled with an inventory of some fifty atomic labels (of the type ?S?, ?NP?, ?VP?</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="12">et al), and (iii) as an underspecified MRS (Copestake, Lascarides,&amp; Flickinger, 2001) meaning representation.</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="13">While representation (ii) will in many cases be similar to the rep resentation found in the Penn Treebank, representation(iii) subsumes the functor ? argument (or tectogrammatical) structure advocated in the Prague Dependency Tree bank or the German TiGer corpus.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="14">Most importantly, however, representation (i) provides all the informationrequired to replay the full HPSG analysis (using the original grammar and one of the open-source HPSG process ing environments, e.g., the LKB or PET, which alreadyhave been interfaced to [incr tsdb()]).</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="15">Using the latter approach, users of the treebank are enabled to extract infor mation in whatever representation they require, simplyby reconstructing full analyses and adapting the exist ing mappings (e.g., the inventory of node labels used forphrase structure trees) to their needs.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="16">Likewise, the existing [incr tsdb()] facilities for comparing across competence and performance profiles can be deployed to evalu ate results of a (stochastic) parse disambiguation system, essentially using the preferences recorded in the treebank as a ?gold standard?</S>
			<S sid="27" ssid="17">target for comparison.Automating Treebank Construction Although a pre cise HPSG grammar like the LinGO ERG will typically assign a small number of analyses to a given sentence,choosing among a few or sometimes a few dozen read ings is time-consuming and error-prone.</S>
			<S sid="28" ssid="18">The project isexploring two approaches to automating the disambiguation task, (i) seeding lexical selection from a part-of speech (POS) tagger and (ii) automated inter-annotator comparison and assisted resolution of conflicts.</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="19">Treebank Maintenance and Evolution One of the challenging research aspects of the Redwoods initiativeis about developing a methodology for automated up dates of the treebank to reflect the continuous evolution of the underlying linguistic framework and of the LinGO grammar.</S>
			<S sid="30" ssid="20">Again building on the notion of elementarylinguistic discriminators, we expect to explore the semiautomatic propagation of recorded disambiguating deci sions into newer versions of the parsed corpus.</S>
			<S sid="31" ssid="21">Whileit can be assumed that the basic phrase structure inven tory and granularity of lexical distinctions have stabilized to a certain degree, it is not guaranteed that one set ofdiscriminators will always fully disambiguate a more recent set of analyses for the same utterance (as the gram mar may introduce new ambiguity), nor that re-playing a history of disambiguating decisions will necessarily identify the correct, preferred analysis for all sentences.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="22">A better understanding of the nature of discriminators and relations holding among them is expected to provide the foundations for an update procedure that, ultimately,should be mostly automated, with minimal manual inspection, and which can become part of the regular re gression test cycle for the grammar.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="23">Scope and Current State of Seeding Initiative The first 10,000 trees to be hand-annotated as part of the kick-off initiative are taken from a domain for which the English Resource Grammar is known to exhibit broadand accurate coverage, viz.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="24">transcribed face-to-face dialogues in an appointment scheduling and travel arrange ment domain.1 For the follow-up phase of the project, it is expected to move into a second domain and text genre,presumably more formal, edited text taken from newspa per text or another widely available on-line source.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="25">As of June 2002, the seeding initiative is well underway.</S>
			<S sid="36" ssid="26">The integrated treebanking environment, combining [incrtsdb()] and the LKB tree selection tool, has been established and has been deployed in a first iteration of anno tating the VerbMobil utterances.</S>
			<S sid="37" ssid="27">The approach to parse selection through minimal discriminators turned out tobe not hard to learn for a second-year Stanford under graduate in linguistics, and allowed completion of the first iteration in less than ten weeks.</S>
			<S sid="38" ssid="28">Table 1 summarizes the current Redwoods status.</S>
			<S sid="39" ssid="29">1Corpora of some 50,000 such utterances are readily available from the VerbMobil project (Wahlster, 2000) and have already been studied extensively among researchers world-wide.</S>
			<S sid="40" ssid="30">2Of the four data sets only VM32 has been double-checked by an expert grammarian and (almost) completely disambiguated to date; therefore it exhibits an interestingly higher degree of phrasal ambiguity in the ?active = 1?</S>

	<SECTION title="Early Experimental Results. " number="3">
			<S sid="46" ssid="1">Development of the treebank has just started.</S>
			<S sid="47" ssid="2">Nonethe less, we have performed some preliminary experimentson concrete applications to motivate the utility of the resource being developed.</S>
			<S sid="48" ssid="3">In this section, we describe ex periments using the Redwoods treebank to build and test systems for parse disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid="49" ssid="4">As a component, we build a tagger for the HPSG lexical tags in the treebank, and report results on this application as well.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="5">Any linguistic system that allows multiple parses of strings must address the problem of selecting from among the admitted parses the preferred one.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="6">A varietyof approaches for building statistical models of parse se lection are possible.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="7">At the simplest end, we might look only at the lexical type sequence assigned to the words by each parse and rank the parse based on the likelihood of that sequence.</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="8">These lexical types ? the preterminals in the derivation ? are essentially part-of-speech tags, but encode considerably finer-grained information about thewords.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="9">Well-understood statistical part-of-speech tag ging technology is sufficient for this approach.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="10">In order to use more information about the parse, we might examine the entire derivation of the string.Most probabilistic parsing research ? including, for ex ample, work by by Collins (1997), and Charniak (1997) ? is based on branching process models (Harris, 1963).</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="11">The HPSG derivations that the treebank makes available can be viewed as just such a branching process, anda stochastic model of the trees can be built as a prob abilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) model.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="12">Abney (1997) notes important problems with the soundness ofthe approach when a unification-based grammar is ac tually determining the derivations, motivating the use of log-linear models (Agresti, 1990) for parse ranking that Johnson and colleagues further developed (Johnson, Geman, Canon, Chi, &amp; Riezler, 1999).</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="13">These models can deal with the many interacting dependencies and the structural complexity found in constraint-based or unification-based theories of syntax.Nevertheless, the naive PCFG approach has the advantage of simplicity, so we pursue it and the tagging approach to parse ranking in these proof-of-concept exper iments (more recently, we have begun work on buildinglog-linear models over HPSG signs (Toutanova &amp; Man ning, 2002)).</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="14">The learned models were used to rank possible parses of unseen test sentences according to theprobabilities they assign to them.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="15">We report parse se lection performance as percentage of test sentences for which the correct parse was highest ranked by the model.</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="16">(We restrict attention in the test corpus to sentences that are ambiguous according to the grammar, that is, for which the parse selection task is nontrivial.)</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="17">We examine four models: an HMM tagging model, a simple PCFG, a PCFG with grandparent annotation, and a hybrid model that combines predictions from the PCFG and the tagger.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="18">These models will be described in more detail presently.The tagger that we have implemented is a standard trigram HMM tagger, defining a joint probability distribu tion over the preterminal sequences and yields of thesetrees.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="19">Trigram probabilities are smoothed by linear in terpolation with lower-order models.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="20">For comparison, we present the performance of a unigram tagger and anupper-bound oracle tagger that knows the true tag se quence and scores highest the parses that have the correct preterminal sequence.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="21">The PCFG models define probability distributions over the trees of derivational types corresponding to theHPSG analyses of sentences.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="22">A PCFG model has parameters ?i, j for each rule Ai ? ?</S>
			<S sid="68" ssid="23">j in the corresponding con text free grammar.3 In our application, the nonterminals in the PCFG Ai are rules of the HPSG grammar used to build the parses (such as HEAD-COMPL or HEAD-ADJ).</S>
			<S sid="69" ssid="24">We set the parameters to maximize the likelihood of theset of derivation trees for the preferred parses of the sentences in a training set.</S>
			<S sid="70" ssid="25">As noted above, estimating prob abilities from local tree counts in the treebank does not provide a maximum likelihood estimate of the observed data, as the grammar rules further constrain the possible derivations.</S>
			<S sid="71" ssid="26">Essentially, we are making an assumption of context-freeness of rule application that does not hold in the case of the HPSG grammar.</S>
			<S sid="72" ssid="27">Nonetheless, we can still build the model and use it to rank parses.</S>
			<S sid="73" ssid="28">3For an introduction to PCFG grammars see, for example, Manning &amp; Schu?tze (1999).</S>
			<S sid="74" ssid="29">As previously noted by other researchers (Charniak &amp;Caroll, 1994), extending a PCFG with grandparent annotation improves the accuracy of the model.</S>
			<S sid="75" ssid="30">We imple mented an extended PCFG that conditions each node?s expansion on its parent in the phrase structure tree.</S>
			<S sid="76" ssid="31">The extended PCFG (henceforth PCFG-GP) has parameters P(Ak Ai ? ?</S>
			<S sid="77" ssid="32">j |Ak, Ai) . The resulting grammar can be viewed as a PCFG whose nonterminals are pairs of the nonterminals of the original PCFG.</S>
			<S sid="78" ssid="33">The combined model scores possible parses using probabilities from the PCFG-GP model together with the probability of the preterminal sequence of the parse treeaccording to a trigram tag sequence model.</S>
			<S sid="79" ssid="34">More specif ically, for a tree T , Score(t) = log(PPCFG-GP(T )) + ? log(PTRIG(tags(T )) where PTRIG(tags(T )) is the probability of the sequence of preterminals t1 ? ?</S>
			<S sid="80" ssid="35">tn in T according to a trigram tag model: PTRIG(t1 ? ?</S>
			<S sid="81" ssid="36">tn) = ?n i=1 P(ti |ti?1, ti?2) with appropriate treatment of boundaries.</S>
			<S sid="82" ssid="37">The trigram probabilities are smoothed as for the HMM tagger.</S>
			<S sid="83" ssid="38">The combined model is relatively insensitive to the relative weights of the two component models, as specified by ?; in any case, exact optimization of this parameter was not performed.</S>
			<S sid="84" ssid="39">We refer to this model as Combined.</S>
			<S sid="85" ssid="40">The Combined model is not a sound probabilistic model as it does not define a probability distribution over parse trees.</S>
			<S sid="86" ssid="41">It does however provide a crude way to combine ancestor and left context information.</S>
			<S sid="87" ssid="42">The second column in Table 2 shows the accuracy of parse selection using the models described above.For comparison, a baseline showing the expected performance of choosing parses randomly according to a uniform distribution is included as the first row.</S>
			<S sid="88" ssid="43">The accu racy results are averaged over a ten-fold cross-validation on the data set summarized in Table 1.</S>
			<S sid="89" ssid="44">The data we usedfor this experiment was the set of disambiguated sen tences that have exactly one preferred parse (comprising a total of 5312 sentences).</S>
			<S sid="90" ssid="45">Often the stochastic modelswe are considering give the same score to several differ ent parses.</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="46">When a model ranks a set of m parses highest with equal scores and one of those parses is the preferred parse in the treebank, we compute the accuracy on this sentence as 1/m.Since our approach of defining the probability of analyses using derivation trees is different from the tradi tional approach of learning PCFG grammars from phrase structure trees, a comparison of the two is probably in order.</S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="47">We tested the model PCFG-GP defined over thecorresponding phrase structure trees and its average accuracy was 65.65% which is much lower than the accu racy of the same model over derivation trees (71.73%).</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="48">This result suggests that the information about grammar constructions is very helpful for parse disambiguation.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="49">Method Task tag sel.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="50">parse sel.</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="51">Random 90.13% 25.81% Tagger unigram 96.75% 44.15% trigram 97.87% 47.74% oracle 100.00% 54.59% PCFG simple 97.40% 66.26% grandparent 97.43% 71.73% combined 98.08% 74.03% Table 2: Performance of the HMM and PCFG models for the tag and parse selection tasks (accuracy).The results in Table 2 indicate that high disambiguation accuracy can be achieved using very simple statisti cal models.</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="52">The performance of the perfect tagger shows that, informally speaking, roughly half of the informationnecessary to disambiguate parses is available in the lexi cal types alone.</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="53">About half of the remaining information is recovered by our best method, Combined.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="54">An alternative (more primitive) task is the tagging task itself.</S>
			<S sid="100" ssid="55">It is interesting to know how much the taggingtask can be improved by perfecting parse disambigua tion.</S>
			<S sid="101" ssid="56">With the availability of a parser, we can examine the accuracy of the tag sequence of the highest scoring parse, rather than trying to tag the word sequence directly.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="57">We refer to this problem as the tag selection problem, by analogy with the relation between the parsing problemand the parse selection problem.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="58">The first column of Ta ble 2 presents the performance of the models on the tag selection problem.</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="59">The results are averaged accuracies over 10 cross-validation splits of the same corpus as theprevious experiment, and show that parse disambigua tion using information beyond the lexical type sequence slightly improves tag selection performance.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="60">Note that in these experiments, the models are used to rank the tag sequences of the possible parses and not to find the mostprobable tag sequence.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="61">Therefore tagging accuracy re sults are higher than they would be in the latter case.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="62">Since our corpus has relatively short sentences and lowambiguity it is interesting to see how much the perfor mance degrades as we move to longer and more highlyambiguous sentences.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="63">For this purpose, we report in Ta ble 3 the parse ranking accuracy of the Combined modelas a function of the number of possible analyses for sen tences.</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="64">Each row corresponds to a set of sentences with number of possible analyses greater or equal to the boundshown in the first column.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="65">For example, the first row con tains information for the sentences with ambiguity ? 2, which is all ambiguous sentences.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="66">The columns show thetotal number of sentences in the set, the expected accuracy of guessing at random, and the accuracy of the Com bined model.</S>
			<S sid="112" ssid="67">We can see that the parse ranking accuracy is decreasing quickly and more powerful models will be needed to achieve good accuracy for highly ambiguous sentences.Despite several differences in corpus size and compo Analyses Sentences Random Combined ? 2 3824 25.81% 74.03% ? 5 1789 9.66% 59.64% ? 10 1027 5.33% 51.61% ? 20 525 3.03% 45.33% Table 3: Parse ranking accuracy by number of possible parses.</S>
			<S sid="113" ssid="68">sition, it is perhaps nevertheless useful to compare thiswork with other work on parse selection for unification based grammars.</S>
			<S sid="114" ssid="69">Johnson et al (1999) estimate a Stochastic Unification Based Grammar (SUBG) using a log-linear model.</S>
			<S sid="115" ssid="70">The features they include in the modelare not limited to production rule features but also ad junct and argument and other linguistically motivated features.</S>
			<S sid="116" ssid="71">On a dataset of 540 sentences (total training and test set) from a Verbmobil corpus they report parsedisambiguation accuracy of 58.7% given a baseline accuracy for choosing at random of 9.7%.</S>
			<S sid="117" ssid="72">The random base line is much lower than ours for the full data set, but it is comparable for the random baseline for sentences with more than 5 analyses.</S>
			<S sid="118" ssid="73">The accuracy of our Combined model for these sentences is 59.64%, so the accuracies of the two models seem fairly similar.</S>
