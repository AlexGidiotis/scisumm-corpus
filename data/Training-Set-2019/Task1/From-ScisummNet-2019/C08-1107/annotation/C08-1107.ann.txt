Our approach is different from theirs in many respects: their goal is paraphrase extraction, while we are extracting directional entailment rules; as textual resources for pattern extraction they use parallel corpora (using patterns in another language as pivots), while we rely on monolingual Wikipedia revisions (taking benefit from its increasing size); the para phrases they extract are more similar to DIRT, while our approach allows to focus on the acquisition of rules for specific phenomena frequent in entailment pairs, and not covered by other resources.</S> | Reference Offset:  NA | Reference Text:  <S sid = NA ssid = NA>We presented two approaches for unsupervised ac quisition of unary entailment rules from regular (non-comparable) corpora.</S><S sid = NA ssid = NA>Most work on unsupervised entailment rule acquisition focused on rules between templates with two variables, ignoring unary rules - entailment rules betweentemplates with a single variable.</S> | Discourse Facet:  NA | Annotator: Automatic
