The approach started with the so-called IBM models (Brown et al, 1988), implementing a set of elementary operations, such as movement, duplication and translation, that independently act on individual words in the source sentence.</S> | Reference Offset:  NA | Reference Text:  <S sid = NA ssid = NA>A Statistical Approach To Language Translation</S> | Discourse Facet:  NA | Annotator: Automatic

The language model tells how probable a given sentence is in the source language, the translation model indicates how likely it is that a particular target sentence is a translation of a given source sentence, and the decoder is what actually takes a source sentence as input and produces its translation as output.</S> | Reference Offset:  NA | Reference Text:  <S sid = NA ssid = NA>A Statistical Approach To Language Translation</S> | Discourse Facet:  NA | Annotator: Automatic
