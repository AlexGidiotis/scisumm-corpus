			<S sid="1" ssid="1">In the simplest terms, an extraction system identifies patterns within the text, and then mat)s some constituents of these patterns into data base entries.</S>
			<S sid="2" ssid="2">(This very simple descrip- lion ignores the problems of anaphora nd in- tersentential inference, which must be addressed by any general event extraction system.)</S>
			<S sid="3" ssid="3">AI- though these l)atterns could in principle be stated in terms of individual words, it is much 940 easier to state them in terms of larger SylltaC- tic constituents, uch as noun phrases and verb groups.</S>
			<S sid="4" ssid="4">Consequently, extraction ormally con- sists of an analysis of the l;e.xt in terms of general linguistic structures and dolnain-specifio con- structs, tbllowed by a search for the scenario- specific patterns.</S>
			<S sid="5" ssid="5">It is possible to build these constituent struc- tures through a flfll syntactic analysis of the text, and the discovery procedure we describe below woul(1 be applicable to such an architec- ture.</S>
			<S sid="6" ssid="6">Howe, ver, for re&amp;sellS of slme,(t , coverage, and system rolmstness, the more (:ommon ap- t)roa(:h at present is to peribrni a t)artial syn- tactic analysis using a cascade of finite-state transducers.</S>
			<S sid="7" ssid="7">This is the at)t)roa(:h used by our e.xtraction system (Grishman, 1995; Yangarber and Grishman, 1998).</S>
			<S sid="8" ssid="8">At; the heart of our syslx'an is a regular ex- pression pattern matcher which is Cal)al)le of matching a set of regular exl)ressions against a partially-analyzed text and producing addi- tional annotations on the text.</S>
			<S sid="9" ssid="9">This core draws on a set of knowledge bases of w~rying degrees of domain- and task-specificity.</S>
			<S sid="10" ssid="10">The lexicon in- cludes both a general English dictionary and definitions of domain and scenario terms.</S>
			<S sid="11" ssid="11">The concept base arranges the domain terms into a semantic hierarchy.</S>
			<S sid="12" ssid="12">The predicate base.</S>
			<S sid="13" ssid="13">de- s('ribes the, logical structure of I;he events to be extracl;od.</S>
			<S sid="14" ssid="14">'Fire pattern \])ase consists of sets of patterns (with associated actions), whi(;h make r(;ferollCO to information Kern the other knowl- e(lge bases.</S>
			<S sid="15" ssid="15">Some t)attorn sots, su(:h as those for n(mn and verb groups, are broadly apl)licable , wlfile other sets are spe(:ifio to the scenario.</S>
			<S sid="16" ssid="16">V~Ze, have previously (Yangarl)er and Grish- man, 1.997) (lescrit)ed a user interface which supt)orts the rapid cust;omization of the extrac- tion system to a new scenario.</S>
			<S sid="17" ssid="17">This interface allows the user to provide examples of role- wmt events, which are automatically converted into the appropriate patterns and generalized to cover syntactic variants (passive, relative clause, etc.).</S>
			<S sid="18" ssid="18">Through this internee, the user can also generalize l;he pattern semanti('ally (to (:over a broader class of words) and modify the concet)t base and lexicon as needed.</S>
			<S sid="19" ssid="19">Given an appro- priate set; of examples, thereibre, it; has become possible to adapt the extraction system quite ral)idly.</S>
			<S sid="20" ssid="20">However, the burden is still on the user to find the appropriate set of examples, which may require a painstaldng and expensive search of a large corpus.</S>
			<S sid="21" ssid="21">Reducing this cost is essential for enhanced system portability; this is the problem addressed by the current research.</S>
			<S sid="22" ssid="22">Ilow can we automatically discover a suitable set; of candidate patterns or examples (patterns which at least have a high likelihood of being relevant to the scenario)?</S>
			<S sid="23" ssid="23">The basic idea is to look for linguistic patterns which apt)ear with relatively high frequency in relevant documents.</S>
			<S sid="24" ssid="24">While there has been prior research oll idea|i- lying the primary lexical t)atterns of a sublan- guage or cortms (Orishman et al 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are tyt)ically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevmlt passages; these passages must themselves be tbund as part of t;t1(; discov- ery i)rocedure.</S>
			<S sid="25" ssid="25">The difficulty is that one of the l)est imlic~tions of the relevance of the passages is t)recisely the t)resence of these constructs.</S>
			<S sid="26" ssid="26">Bo- (:ause of this (:ircularity, we l)ropose to a(:quire.</S>

			<S sid="28" ssid="1">We tirst outline ExDIsco , our procedure for discovery of oxl,raction patterns; details of some of the stops arc l)rcse, nted in the section which follows, and an earlier t)~q)er on our at)l)roach (Yang~u:bcr ot al., 2000).</S>
			<S sid="29" ssid="2">ExDIscO is mi ml- supervised 1)rocedure: the training (:ortms does not need to t)e amlotated with the specific event intbrmatkm to be.</S>

			<S sid="31" ssid="4">'i7tlo only intbrmation the user must provide, as described below, is a small set of seed patterns regarding the s(:enario.</S>
			<S sid="32" ssid="5">Starting with this seed, the system automati- (:ally pertbnns a repeated, automatic expansion of the pattern set.</S>
			<S sid="33" ssid="6">This is analogous to the pro- cess of automatic t;enn expansion used in s()me information retrieval systems, where, the terlns Dora the most relewmt doculncnts are added to the user query and then a new retriewfl is imrformed.</S>
			<S sid="34" ssid="7">However, by expanding in terms of 1)atl;erns rather than individual terms, a more precise expansion is possit)le.</S>
			<S sid="35" ssid="8">This process pro- coeds as tbllows: 0.</S>

			<S sid="49" ssid="1">3.1 Pre-processing: Syntact ic Analysis.</S>
			<S sid="50" ssid="2">Before at)plying ExDIsco , we pre-proeessed the cortms using a general-purpose d pendency parser of English.</S>
			<S sid="51" ssid="3">The parser is based on the FDG tbrmalism (Tapanainen and Jgrvi- hen, 1997) and developed by the Research Unit for Multilingual Language Technology at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor Oy.</S>
			<S sid="52" ssid="4">The parser is used ibr reducing each clause or noun phrase to a tuple, consisting of the central ar- guments, ms described in detail in (Yangarber et al, 2000).</S>
			<S sid="53" ssid="5">We used a corlms of 9,224 articles from the Wall Street; Journal.</S>
			<S sid="54" ssid="6">The parsed arti- cles yielded a total of 440,000 clausal tuples, of which 215,000 were distinct.</S>
			<S sid="55" ssid="7">3.2 Normal izat ion.</S>
			<S sid="56" ssid="8">We applied a name recognition module prior to parsing, and replaced each name with a token describing its (:lass, e.g. C-Person, C-Company, etc. We collapsed together all numeric expres- sions, currency wflues, dates, etc., using a single token to designate ach of these classes.</S>
			<S sid="57" ssid="9">Lastly, the parser performed syntactic normalization to transtbrm such variants ms the various passive and relative clauses into a common tbrm.</S>
			<S sid="58" ssid="10">3.3 General izat ion and Concept Classes.</S>
			<S sid="59" ssid="11">Because tuples may not repeat with sufficient frequency to obtain reliable statistics, each tu- ple is reduced to a set of pints: e.g., a verb- object pair, a subject-object pair, etc. Each pair is used as a generalized pattern during the can- didate selection stage.</S>
			<S sid="60" ssid="12">Once we have identitied pairs which are relevant o the scenario, we use them to gather the set; of words for the miss- ing role(s) (tbr example, a class of verbs which occur with a relevant subject-ot@ct pair: "com- pany {hire/fire/expel...}</S>
			<S sid="61" ssid="13">person").</S>
			<S sid="62" ssid="14">3.4 Pat tern Discovery.</S>
			<S sid="63" ssid="15">We (-onducte(1 exi)eriments in several scenarios within news domains such as changes in cor- porate ownership, and natural disasters.</S>
			<S sid="64" ssid="16">Itere we present results on the "Man~geme.nt Suc- cession" and "Mergers/Acquisitions" cenarios.</S>
			<S sid="65" ssid="17">ExDIsco was seeded with lninimal pattern sets, namely: Subject Verb Direct Object C-Company C-At)point C-Person C-Person C-Resign ibr the Mmmgement task, and Subject Verb Direct Object * C-Buy C-Conlt)any C-Company merge * for Acquisitions.</S>
			<S sid="66" ssid="18">Here C-Company and C- Person denote semantic classes containing named entities of the corresponding types.</S>
			<S sid="67" ssid="19">C- Appoint denotes the list of verbs { appoint, elect, promote, name, nominate}, C-Resign = { re- sign, depart, quit }, and C-Buy = { buy , pur- chase }.</S>

			<S sid="90" ssid="5">We have evaluated ExDIsco by manually incorporating the discovered pat- terns into the Proteus knowledge bases and run- ning a full MUC-style evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="91" ssid="6">We started with our extraction system, Pro- tens, which was used in MUC-6 in 1995, and has undergone continual improvements since the MUC evaluation.</S>
			<S sid="92" ssid="7">We removed all the scenario-specific clause and nominalization pat- terns.</S>
			<S sid="93" ssid="8">4 We then reviewed all the patterns which were generated by the ExDIsco, deleting those which were not relewmt to the task, or which did not correspond irectly to a predicate al- ready implemented tbr this task) The remain- ing pat;terns were augmented with intbnnation about the corresponding predicate, and the re- lation between the pattern and the predicate al'guments, a The resulting variants of Proteus were applied to the formal training corpus and the (hidden) formal test corpus for MUC-6, and the output evaluated with the MUC scorer.</S>
			<S sid="94" ssid="9">The results on the training corpus are: Pattern Base Recall Precision Seed 38 83 Ex I ) Isco 62 80 Union 69 __79 Manual-MUC ~ 71 L~1.9~ Manual-NOW 6(3~ 79 L7!~z\[)_t_j and on the test cortms: 4There are also a few noun phrase patterns which can give rise to scenario events.</S>
			<S sid="95" ssid="10">For example, "Mr Smith, former president of IBM", may produce an event record where l%ed Smith left IBM.</S>
			<S sid="96" ssid="11">These patterns were left in Proteus for all the runs, and they make some contribu- tion to the relatively high baseline scores obtained using just the seed event patterns.</S>
			<S sid="97" ssid="12">~ExD~sco f und patterns which were relevant to the task lint could not be easily aceomodated in Proteus.</S>
			<S sid="98" ssid="13">For instance "X remained as president" could be rele- vant, particularly in the case of a merger creating anew corporate ntity, but Proteus was not equipped to trun- dle such iIfformation, and has not yet been extended to incorporate such patterns.</S>
			<S sid="99" ssid="14">6As with all clause-level patterns in Proteus, these patterns m-e automatically generalized tohandle syntac- tic wn'iants uch as passive, relative clause, etc. Pattern Base Recall Precision F Seed 27 74 39.58 ExDIsco 52 72 60.16 Union 57 73 63.56 Manual-NOW -- 56 75 6404.</S>

			<S sid="101" ssid="16">The Seed pat- tern base consists of just the initial pattern set, given in the table on the previous page.</S>
			<S sid="102" ssid="17">~ib this we added the patterns which the system discov- ered automatically after about 100 iterations, producing the pattern set called ExDIsco.</S>
			<S sid="103" ssid="18">For comparison, M anual-MUC is the pattern base lnanually develot)ed on the MUC-6 training corpus-1)repared over the course of 1 month of full-time work by at least one computational linguist (during which the 100-document train- ing corpus was studied in detail).</S>
			<S sid="104" ssid="19">The last row, Manual-now, shows the current pertbrmance of the Proteus system.</S>
			<S sid="105" ssid="20">The base called Ultiolt con- tains the union of ExDIScO and Manual-No'w.</S>
			<S sid="106" ssid="21">We find these results very encouraging: Pro- teus performs better with the patterns discov- ered by ExI)IscO than it did after one month of manual tinting and development; in fact, this perfi)rmance is close to current levels, which are the result of substantial additional devel- opmeut.</S>
			<S sid="107" ssid="22">These results umst be interpreted, however, with several caveats.</S>
			<S sid="108" ssid="23">First, Proteus performance depends on many fimtors besides the event patterns, such as the quality of name re, cognition, syntactic mmlysis, anaphora reso~ lution, inferencing, etc. Several of these were improved since the MUC formal evaluation, so some of the gain over the MUC formal evalua- tion score is attritmtable to these factors.</S>
			<S sid="109" ssid="24">How~ ever, all of the other scores are comparable in these regards.</S>
			<S sid="110" ssid="25">Second, as we noted above, the patterns were reviewed and augmented manu- ally, so the overall procedure is not entirely au- tomatic.</S>
			<S sid="111" ssid="26">However, the review and augmenta- tion process took little time, as compared to the manual corpus analysis and development of the pattern base.</S>

			<S sid="131" ssid="5">These techniques may re- duce the level of systeln expertise required to develop a new extraction N)plieation, but they do not lessen the lmrden of studying a large cor- lms in order to .find relevant candidates.</S>
			<S sid="132" ssid="6">The prior work most closely related to our own is that of (R.ilotf, 1996), who also seeks to lmild pattenls automatically without the need to annotate a corpus with the information to be extracted.</S>
			<S sid="133" ssid="7">Itowever, her work ditfers t'rom 01217 own in several i lnportant respects.</S>
			<S sid="134" ssid="8">First, her patterns identit~y phrases that fill individual slots in the template, without specifying how these slots may be combined at a later stage into complete templates.</S>
			<S sid="135" ssid="9">In contrast, our pro- cedure discovers complete, multi-slot event pat- 945 terns.</S>
			<S sid="136" ssid="10">Second, her procedure relies on a cort)us in which |;tie documents have been classified for relevance by hand (it was applied to the MUC-3 task, tbr which over 1500 classified documents are available), whereas ExDIsco requires no manual relevance judgements.</S>
			<S sid="137" ssid="11">While classify- ing documents tbr relevance is much easier than annotating docunlents with the information to be extracted, it; is still a significant ask, and places a limit on |:tie size of the training corpus that can be effectively used.</S>
			<S sid="138" ssid="12">Our research as demonstrated that for the studied scenarios automatic pattern discovery Call yield extraction perfi)rmance colnt)arabh~ to that obtained through extensive corpus anal- ysis.</S>
			<S sid="139" ssid="13">There are many directions in which the work reported here needs to be extended: ? nsing larger training corpora, in order to find less frequent exanlplcs, and in that way hopefully exceeding the i)erfornlancc of our best hand-trained system ? cat)luring the word classes which are gen- erated as a by-product of our pattern dis- covery 1)rocedure (in a manner similar to (Riloff and ,Jones, 1999)) and using them to discover less frequent )atterns in subse- quent iterations - evaluating the effectiveness of the discov- cry procedure on other scenarios.</S>
			<S sid="140" ssid="14">In par- titular, we need to be able to identi\[y top- its which cast be most effbctively charac- terized by clause-level patterns (as was the case tbr the business domain), and topics which can be better characterized by other means.</S>
			<S sid="141" ssid="15">We.</S>
			<S sid="142" ssid="16">wouM also like to understand how the topic clusters (of documents and patterns) which are developed by our pro- cedure line up with pre-specified scenarios.</S>
