<S sid ="1" ssid = "1">Any NLP application that presumes as input unrestricted text requires an initial phase of text analysis; such applications involve problems as diverse as machine translation, information retrieval, and text-to-speech synthesis (TIS).</S>
<S sid ="2" ssid = "2">An initial step of any textÂ­ analysis task is the tokenization of the input into words.</S>
<S sid ="3" ssid = "3">For a language like English, this problem is generally regarded as trivial since words are delimited in English text by whitespace or marks of punctuation.</S>
<S sid ="4" ssid = "4">Thus in an English sentence such as I&apos;m going to show up at the ACL one would reasonably conjecture that there are eight words separated by seven spaces.</S>
<S sid ="5" ssid = "5">A moment&apos;s reflection will reveal that things are not quite that simple.</S>
<S sid ="6" ssid = "6">There are clearly eight orthographic words in the example given, but if one were doing syntactic analysis one would probably want to consider I&apos;m to consist of two syntactic words, namely I and am.</S>
<S sid ="7" ssid = "7">If one is interested in translation, one would probably want to consider show up as a single dictionary word since its semantic interpretation is not trivially derivable from the meanings of show and up.</S>
<S sid ="8" ssid = "8">And if one is interested in TIS, one would probably consider the single orthographic word ACL to consist of three phonological words-lei s&apos;i d/-corresponding to the pronunciation of each of the letters in the acronym.</S>
