As is described in Section 4, the property of having a derivation tree set that is a local set appears to be useful in showing important properties of the languages generated by the formalisms.In addition, the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a more general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars, and the hierarchy defined by Weir).Hence, trees shown in Figure 8 can not be generated by any MCTAG (but can be generated by an IG) because the number of pairs of dependent paths grows with n. Since the derivation tees of TAG's, MCTAG's, and HG's are local sets, the choice of the structure used at each point in a derivation in these systems does not depend on the context at that point within the derivation.Thus, as in CFG's, at any point in the derivation, the set of structures that can be applied is determined only by a finite set of rules encapsulated by the grammar.The independence of paths in the tree sets of the k tI grammatical formalism in this hierarchy can be shown by means of tree pumping lemma of the form t1ti3t .It is striking that from this point of view many formalisms can be grouped together as having identically structured derivation tree sets.
