To establish a soft correspondence between the two languages, we use a second similarity function, which leverages standard unsupervised word alignment statistics (ยง3.3).3 Since we have no labeled foreign data, our goal is to project syntactic information from the English side to the foreign side.To bridge this gap, we consider a practically motivated scenario, in which we want to leverage existing resources from a resource-rich language (like English) when building tools for resource-poor foreign languages.1 We assume that absolutely no labeled training data is available for the foreign language of interest, but that we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language.Because we are interested in applying our techniques to languages for which no labeled resources are available, we paid particular attention to minimize the number of free parameters and used the same hyperparameters for all language pairs.Our method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (in particular no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.(2009) study related but different multilingual grammar and tagger induction tasks, where it is assumed that no labeled data at all is available.
