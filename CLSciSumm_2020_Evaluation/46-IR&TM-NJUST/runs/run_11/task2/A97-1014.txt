Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages, several features have been added, influencing the architecture of the scheme.In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.Apart from this rather technical problem, two further arguments speak against phrase structure as the structural pivot of the annotation scheme: Finally, the structural handling of free word order means stating well-formedness constraints on structures involving many trace-filler dependencies, which has proved tedious.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience, we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.As the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees, it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects.In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.
