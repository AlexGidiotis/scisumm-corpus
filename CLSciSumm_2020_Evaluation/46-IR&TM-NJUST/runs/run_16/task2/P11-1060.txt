As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.For example, area (by virtue which results in programs (DCS trees) which are of being a noun) triggers many predicates: city, much simpler than the logically-equivalent lambda state, area, etc.It is impossible to represent the semantics of this phrase with just a CSP, so we introduce a new aggregate relation, notated E. Consider a tree hE:ci, whose root is connected to a child c via E. If the denotation of c is a set of values s, the parent’s denotation is then a singleton set containing s. Formally: Figure 3(a) shows the DCS tree for our running example.These rules are often too stringent, cused on aligning text to a world (Liang et al., 2009), and for complex utterances, especially in free word- using text in reinforcement learning (Branavan et al., order languages, either disharmonic combinators are 2009; Branavan et al., 2010), and many others.The closest work to ours is Clarke on compositional semantics.For example, in Figure 4(a), before execution, the denotation of the DCS tree is hh{[(CA, OR), (OR)],... }; ø; (E, Qhstatei�w, ø)ii; after applying X1, we have hh{[(OR)], ... }; øii.This evaluation is done with respect to a world w. Recall that a world w maps each predicate p ∈ P to a set of tuples w(p).
