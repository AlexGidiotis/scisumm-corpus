In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.As in the case of the derivation trees of CFG's, nodes are labeled by a member of some finite set of symbols (perhaps only implicit in the grammar as in TAG's) used to denote derived structures.From the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).We place certain restrictions on the composition operations of LCFRS's, restrictions that are shared by the composition operations of the constrained grammatical systems that we have considered.We outlined the definition of a family of constrained grammatical formalisms, called Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems.An extension of the TAG system was introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) and later redefined by Joshi (1987) in which the adjunction operation is defined on sets of elementary trees rather than single trees.These systems are similar to those described by Pollard (1984) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars (GCFG's).An IG can be viewed as a CFG in which each nonterminal is associated with a stack.
