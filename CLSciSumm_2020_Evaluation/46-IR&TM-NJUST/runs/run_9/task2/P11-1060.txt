Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.In this paper, we learn to map questions to answers via latent logical forms, which are induced automatically from question-answer pairs.As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.5 Discussion Piantadosi et al. (2008) induces first-order formuA major focus of this work is on our semantic rep- lae using CCG in a small domain assuming observed resentation, DCS, which offers a new perspective lexical semantics.The core problem that arises in this setting is program induction: finding a logical form z (over an exponentially large space of possibilities) that produces the target answer y.Answering these types of complex questions compositionally involves first mapping the questions into logical forms (semantic parsing).The main technical contribution of this work is a new semantic representation, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which is both simple and expressive (Section 2).In each dataset, each sentence x is annotated with a Prolog logical form, which we use only to evaluate and get an answer y.It is this transparency between syntax and semantics provided by DCS which leads to a simple and streamlined compositional semantics suitable for program induction.
