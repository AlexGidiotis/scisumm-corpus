We then discuss how we adapt and generalize a boosting algorithm, AdaBoost, to the problem of named entity classification.971,746 sentences of New York Times text were parsed using the parser of (Collins 96).1 Word sequences that met the following criteria were then extracted as named entity examples: whose head is a singular noun (tagged NN).In addition to the named-entity string (Maury Cooper or Georgia), a contextual predictor was also extracted.The 2(Yarowsky 95) describes the use of more sophisticated smoothing methods.The first method builds on results from (Yarowsky 95) and (Blum and Mitchell 98).Several extensions of AdaBoost for multiclass problems have been suggested (Freund and Schapire 97; Schapire and Singer 98).The second algorithm builds on a boosting algorithm called AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire 97; Schapire and Singer 98).Unsupervised Models for Named Entity Classification Collins
