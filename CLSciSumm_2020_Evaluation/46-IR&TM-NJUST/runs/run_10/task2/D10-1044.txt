We will also directly compare with a baseline similar to the Matsoukas et al approach in order to measure the benefit from weighting phrase pairs (or ngrams) rather than full sentences.To approximate these baselines, we implemented a very simple sentence selection algorithm in which parallel sentence pairs from OUT are ranked by the perplexity of their target half according to the IN language model.This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.To set β, we used the same criterion as for α, over a dev corpus: The MAP combination was used for TM probabilities only, in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard LM smoothing techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995).3 Motivated by information retrieval, a number of approaches choose “relevant” sentence pairs from OUT by matching individual source sentences from IN (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L¨u et al., 2007), or individual target hypotheses (Zhao et al., 2004).Daum´e (2007) applies a related idea in a simpler way, by splitting features into general and domain-specific versions.
