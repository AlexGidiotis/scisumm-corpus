Since the combinatorics of syntactic constructions creates a. demand for very large corpora., efficiency of annotation is an important. criterion for the success of the developed methodology and tools.In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience, we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.The difference between the particular NK's lies in the positional and part-of-speech information, which is also sufficient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.Existing treebank annotation schemes exhibit a fairly uniform architecture, as they all have to meet the same basic requirements, namely: Descriptivity: Grammatical phenomena are to be described rather than explained.As the annotation scheme described in this paper focusses on annotating argument structure rather than constituent trees, it differs from existing treebanks in several aspects.In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.Because of the intended theory-independence of the scheme, we annotate only the common minimum.Data-drivenness: The scheme must provide representational means for all phenomena occurring in texts.
