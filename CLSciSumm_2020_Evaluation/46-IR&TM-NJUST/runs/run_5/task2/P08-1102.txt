On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.We trained a character-based perceptron for Chinese Joint S&T, and found that the perceptron itself could achieve considerably high accuracy on segmentation and Joint S&T.At the first step, we conducted a group of contrasting experiments on the core perceptron, the first concentrated on the segmentation regardless of the POS information and reported the F-measure on segmentation only, while the second performed Joint S&T using POS information and reported the F-measure both on segmentation and on Joint S&T.Compared to performing segmentation and POS tagging one at a time, Joint S&T can achieve higher accuracy not only on segmentation but also on POS tagging (Ng and Low, 2004).Besides the usual character-based features, additional features dependent on POSâ€™s or words can also be employed to improve the performance.As all the sub-models, including the perceptron, are regarded as separate features of the outside-layer linear model, we can train them respectively with special algorithms.In order to test the performance of the lexical-target templates and meanwhile determine the best iterations over the training corpus, we randomly chosen 2, 000 shorter sentences (less than 50 words) as the development set and the rest as the training set (84, 294 sentences), then trained a perceptron model named NON-LEX using only nonlexical-target features and another named LEX using both the two kinds of features.
