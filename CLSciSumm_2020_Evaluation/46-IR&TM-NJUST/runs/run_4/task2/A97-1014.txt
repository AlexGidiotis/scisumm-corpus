In addition the approach provides empirical material for psycholinguistic investigation, since preferences for the choice of certain syntactic constructions, linea.rizations, and attachments that have been observed in online experiments of language production and comprehension can now be put in relation with the frequency of these alternatives in larger amounts of texts.The difference between the particular NK's lies in the positional and part-of-speech information, which is also sufficient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.Because of the intended theory-independence of the scheme, we annotate only the common minimum.Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure, the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement, can be satisfied.Combining raw language data with linguistic information offers a promising basis for the development of new efficient and robust NLP methods.In section 2, we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).During the second annotation stage, the annotation is enriched with information about thematic roles, quantifier scope and anaphoric reference.Thus the context-free constituent backbone plays a pivotal role in the annotation scheme.
