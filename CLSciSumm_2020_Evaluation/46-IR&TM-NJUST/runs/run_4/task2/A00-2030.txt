In this section, we describe the algorithm that was used to automatically produce augmented trees, starting with a) human-generated semantic annotations and b) machinegenerated syntactic parse trees.To produce a corpus of augmented parse trees, we used the following multi-step training procedure which exploited the Penn TREEBANK Applying this procedure yielded a new version of the semantically annotated corpus, now annotated with complete augmented trees like that in Figure 3.The detailed probability structure differs, however, in that it was designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging, name finding, syntactic parsing, and relation finding in a single process.Instead, we applied an information retrieval system to select a large number of articles from the desired sources, yielding a corpus rich in the desired types of events.Because generative statistical models had already proven successful for each of the first three stages, we were optimistic that some of their properties — especially their ability to learn from large amounts of data, and their robustness when presented with unexpected inputs — would also benefit semantic analysis.While performance did not quite match the best previously reported results for any of these three tasks, we were pleased to observe that the scores were at or near state-of-the-art levels for all cases.We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al. 1993), and more recently, had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.
