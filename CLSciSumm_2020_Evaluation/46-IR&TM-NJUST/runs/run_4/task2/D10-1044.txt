We used 22 features for the logistic weighting model, divided into two groups: one intended to reflect the degree to which a phrase pair belongs to general language, and one intended to capture similarity to the IN domain.This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.To set β, we used the same criterion as for α, over a dev corpus: The MAP combination was used for TM probabilities only, in part due to a technical difficulty in formulating coherent counts when using standard LM smoothing techniques (Kneser and Ney, 1995).3 Motivated by information retrieval, a number of approaches choose “relevant” sentence pairs from OUT by matching individual source sentences from IN (Hildebrand et al., 2005; L¨u et al., 2007), or individual target hypotheses (Zhao et al., 2004).For the LM, adaptive weights are set as follows: where α is a weight vector containing an element αi for each domain (just IN and OUT in our case), pi are the corresponding domain-specific models, and ˜p(w, h) is an empirical distribution from a targetlanguage training corpus—we used the IN dev set for this.
