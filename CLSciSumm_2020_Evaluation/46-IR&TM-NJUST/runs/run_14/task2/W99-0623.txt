The PCFG was trained from the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the other three parsers.Another technique for parse hybridization is to use a naïve Bayes classifier to determine which constituents to include in the parse.In Table 1 we see with very few exceptions that the isolated constituent precision is less than 0.5 when we use the constituent label as a feature.The set is then compared with the set generated from the Penn Treebank parse to determine the precision and recall.One side of the decision making process is when we choose to believe a constituent should be in the parse, even though only one parser suggests it.Under certain conditions the constituent voting and naïve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.This is the only important case, because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent.It is closer to the smaller value of precision and recall when there is a large skew in their values.One can trivially create situations in which strictly binary-branching trees are combined to create a tree with only the root node and the terminal nodes, a completely flat structure.The machine learning community has been in a similar situation and has studied the combination of multiple classifiers (Wolpert, 1992; Heath et al., 1996).We call this approach parse hybridization.
