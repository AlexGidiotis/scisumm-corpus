This is a straightforward technique that is arguably better suited to the adaptation task than the standard method of treating representative IN sentences as queries, then pooling the match results.We obtained positive results using a very simple phrase-based system in two different adaptation settings: using English/French Europarl to improve a performance on a small, specialized medical domain; and using non-news portions of the NIST09 training material to improve performance on the news-related corpora.The general-language features have a slight advantage over the similarity features, and both are better than the SVM feature.These estimates are in turn combined linearly with relative-frequency estimates from an in-domain phrase table.This combination generalizes (2) and (3): we use either at = a to obtain a fixed-weight linear combination, or at = cI(t)/(cI(t) + 0) to obtain a MAP combination.Maximizing (7) is thus much faster than a typical MERT run. where co(s, t) are the counts from OUT, as in (6).Figure 1 shows sample sentences from these domains, which are widely divergent.We extend the Matsoukas et al approach in several ways.
