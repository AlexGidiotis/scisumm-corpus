The difference between the particular NK's lies in the positional and part-of-speech information, which is also sufficient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure, the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement, can be satisfied.As modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data., interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.In addition, we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient, for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment, site is chosen.Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.The work reported in this paper aims at providing syntactically annotated corpora (treebanks') for stochastic grammar induction.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).In such cases, an additional edge is drawn from the embedded VP node to the controller, thus changing the syntactic tree into a graph.We distinguish five degrees of automation: So far, about 1100 sentences of our corpus have been annotated.
