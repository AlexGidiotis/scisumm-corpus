In addition, the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a more general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars, and the hierarchy defined by Weir).However, in order to capture the properties of various grammatical systems under consideration, our notation is more restrictive that ILFP, which was designed as a general logical notation to characterize the complete class of languages that are recognizable in polynomial time.We examine both the complexity of the paths of trees in the tree sets, and the kinds of dependencies that the formalisms can impose between paths.Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.From the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).In this paper, our goal has been to use the notion of LCFRS's to classify grammatical systems on the basis of their strong generative capacity.This allows an unbounded amount of information about two separate paths (e.g. an encoding of their length) to be combined and used to influence the later derivation.
