We check, how likely only up to k = 20 better scores out of n = 100 would have been generated by two equal systems, using the binomial distribution: If p(0..k; n, p) < 0.05, or p(0..k; n, p) > 0.95 then we have a statistically significant difference between the systems.If one system is perfect, another has slight flaws and the third more flaws, a judge is inclined to hand out judgements of 5, 4, and 3.In Figure 4, we displayed the number of system comparisons, for which we concluded statistical significance.This is demonstrated by average scores over all systems, in terms of BLEU, fluency and adequacy, as displayed in Figure 5.Still, for about good number of sentences, we do have this direct comparison, which allows us to apply the sign test, as described in Section 2.2.While we had up to 11 submissions for a translation direction, we did decide against presenting all 11 system outputs to the human judge.Following this method, we repeatedly — say, 1000 times — sample sets of sentences from the output of each system, measure their BLEU score, and use these 1000 BLEU scores as basis for estimating a confidence interval.We divide up each test set into blocks of 20 sentences (100 blocks for the in-domain test set, 53 blocks for the out-of-domain test set), check for each block, if one system has a higher BLEU score than the other, and then use the sign test.
