Three state-of-the-art statistical parsers are combined to produce more accurate parses, as well as new bounds on achievable Treebank parsing accuracy.We have developed a general approach for combining parsers when preserving the entire structure of a parse tree is important.The entries in this table can be compared with those of Table 3 to see how the performance of the combining techniques degrades in the presence of an inferior parser.The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date.The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5% when we added this new parser, but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly.We do not show the numbers for the Bayes models in Table 2 because the parameters involved were established using this set.This is the first set that gives us a fair evaluation of the Bayes models, and the Bayes switching model performs significantly better than its non-parametric counterpart.We show the results of three of the experiments we conducted to measure isolated constituent precision under various partitioning schemes.It is chosen such that the decisions it made in including or excluding constituents are most probable under the models for all of the parsers.
