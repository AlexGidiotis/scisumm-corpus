Compositional question answering begins by mapping questions to logical forms, but training a semantic parser to perform this mapping typically requires the costly annotation of the target logical forms.The logical forms in this framework are trees, which is desirable for two reasons: (i) they parallel syntactic dependency trees, which facilitates parsing and learning; and (ii) evaluating them to obtain the answer is computationally efficient.As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.Free from the burden It also allows us to easily add new lexical triggers of annotating logical forms, we hope to use our without becoming mired in the semantic formalism. techniques in developing even more accurate and Quantifiers and superlatives significantly compli- broader-coverage language understanding systems. cate scoping in lambda calculus, and often type rais- Acknowledgments We thank Luke Zettlemoyer ing needs to be employed.5 Discussion Piantadosi et al.
