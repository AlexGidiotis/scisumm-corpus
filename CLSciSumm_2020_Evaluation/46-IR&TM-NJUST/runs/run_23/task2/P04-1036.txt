We use an allwords task because the predominant senses will reflect the sense distributions of all nouns within the documents, rather than a lexical sample task, where the target words are manually determined and the results will depend on the skew of the words in the sample.This is not ideal since we expect that the sense frequency distributions within SemCor will differ from those in the BNC, from which we obtain our thesaurus.We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task.In order to see how well the automatically acquired predominant sense performs on a WSD task from which the WordNet sense ordering has not been taken, we use the SENSEVAL-2 all-words data (Palmer et al., 2001).In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.We also calculate the WSD accuracy that would be obtained on SemCor, when using our first sense in all contexts ( ).There were a similar number of words that were not covered by a predominant sense in SemCor.We do not assume that the predominant sense is a method of WSD in itself.
