On the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.With a character-based perceptron as the core, combined with realvalued features such as language models, the cascaded model is able to efficiently utilize knowledge sources that are inconvenient to incorporate into the perceptron directly.In our experiments we trained a 3-gram word language model measuring the fluency of the segmentation result, a 4-gram POS language model functioning as the product of statetransition probabilities in HMM, and a word-POS co-occurrence model describing how much probably a word sequence coexists with a POS sequence.Shown in Figure 1, the cascaded model has a two-layer architecture, with a characterbased perceptron as the core combined with other real-valued features such as language models.At the first step, we conducted a group of contrasting experiments on the core perceptron, the first concentrated on the segmentation regardless of the POS information and reported the F-measure on segmentation only, while the second performed Joint S&T using POS information and reported the F-measure both on segmentation and on Joint S&T.It is a better idea to perform segmentation and POS tagging jointly in a uniform framework.
