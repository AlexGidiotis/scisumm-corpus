The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.However, in a two stage system we can incorporate features over the entire output of the unlabeled parser since that structure is fixed as input.For instance, the system of McDonald et al. (2005a) incorporates features over the part of speech of words occurring between and around a possible head-dependent relation.This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006).In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006).We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.It is our hypothesis that for languages with fine-grained label sets, joint parsing and labeling will improve performance.However, recently their has been a revived interest in parsing models that produce dependency graph representations of sentences, which model words and their arguments through directed edges (Hudson, 1984; Mel'Ë‡cuk, 1988).These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.
