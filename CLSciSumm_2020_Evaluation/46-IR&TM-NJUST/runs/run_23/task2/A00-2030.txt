In this paper we report adapting a lexic al ized, probabilistic context-free parser to information extraction and evaluate this new technique on MUC-7 template elements and template relations.Given multiple constituents that cover identical spans in the chart, only those constituents with probabilities within a While our focus throughout the project was on TE and TR, we became curious about how well the model did at part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and at name finding.In this paper, we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.We have demonstrated, at least for one problem, that a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.The detailed probability structure differs, however, in that it was designed to jointly perform part-of-speech tagging, name finding, syntactic parsing, and relation finding in a single process.Our system for MUC-7 consisted of the sentential model described in this paper, coupled with a simple probability model for cross-sentence merging.We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh, 1998).We evaluated part-of-speech tagging and parsing accuracy on the Wall Street Journal using a now standard procedure (see Collins 97), and evaluated name finding accuracy on the MUC7 named entity test.Chiba, (1999) was able to use such a parsing algorithm to reduce perplexity with the long term goal of improved speech recognition.
