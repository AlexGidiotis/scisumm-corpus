Tsarfaty (2006) argues that for Semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task.This analyzer setting is similar to that of (Cohen and Smith, 2007), and models using it are denoted nohsp, Parser and Grammar We used BitPar (Schmid, 2004), an efficient general purpose parser,10 together with various treebank grammars to parse the input sentences and propose compatible morphological segmentation and syntactic analysis.In the current work morphological analyses and lexical probabilities are derived from a small Treebank, which is by no means the best way to go.Such analyzers propose multiple segmentation possibilities and their corresponding analyses for a token in isolation but have no means to determine the most likely ones.Such resources exist for Hebrew (Itai et al., 2006), but unfortunately use a tagging scheme which is incompatible with the one of the Hebrew Treebank.s For this reason, we use a data-driven morphological analyzer derived from the training data similar to (Cohen and Smith, 2007).The current work treats both segmental and super-segmental phenomena, yet we note that there may be more adequate ways to treat supersegmental phenomena assuming Word-Based morphology as we explore in (Tsarfaty and Goldberg, 2008).Since the lattice L for a given sentence W is determined by the morphological analyzer M we have which is precisely the formula corresponding to the so-called lattice parsing familiar from speech recognition.
