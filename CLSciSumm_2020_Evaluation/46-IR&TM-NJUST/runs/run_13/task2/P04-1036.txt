Whilst we have used WordNet as our sense inventory, it would be possible to use this method with another inventory given a measure of semantic relatedness between the neighbours and the senses.Our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by SemCor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.However, the most accurate WSD systems are those which require manually sense tagged data in the first place, and their accuracy depends on the quantity of training examples (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002) available.We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.In many cases the sense ranking provided in SemCor differs to that obtained automatically because we used the BNC to produce our thesaurus.We see that both domains have a similarly high percentage of factotum (domain independent) labels, but as we would expect, the other peaks correspond to the economy label for the FINANCE corpus, and the sports label for the SPORTS corpus. inant senses for 38 polysemous words ranked using the SPORTS and FINANCE corpus.Most research in WSD concentrates on using contextual features, typically neighbouring words, to help determine the correct sense of a target word.In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.
