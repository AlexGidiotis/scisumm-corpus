We describe an annotation scheme and a tool developed for creating linguistically annotated corpora for non-configurational languages.In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.Such a word order independent representation has the advantage of all structural information being encoded in a single data structure.As modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data., interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.In section 2, we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).
