Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.Collins & Duffy (2002) showed how the perceptron algorithm can be used to efficiently compute the best parse with DOP1's subtrees, reporting a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model in Collins (1999) on the WSJ.This may be explained by the fact our best results in Bod (2001) were obtained by testing various subtree restrictions until the highest accuracy was obtained, while in the current experiment we used all subtrees as given by the PCFG-reduction.The distinctive feature of the DOP approach when it was proposed in 1992 was to model sentence structures on the basis of previously observed frequencies of sentence structure fragments, without imposing any constraints on the size of these fragments.Bod reports state-of-the-art results with this method, and observes no decrease in parse accuracy when larger subtrees are included (using subtrees up to depth 14).
