In considering the relationship between formalisms, we show that it is useful to abstract away from the details of the formalism, and examine the nature of their derivation process as reflected by properties their trees. find that several of the formalisms considered can be seen as being closely related since they have derivation tree sets with the same structure as those produced by Context-Free Grammars On the basis of this observation, we describe a class of formalisms which we call Linear Context- Free Rewriting Systems, and show they are recognizable in polynomial time and generate only semilinear languages.We consider the structural descriptions produced by various grammatical formalisms in terms of the complexity of the paths and the relationship between paths in the sets of structural descriptions that each system can generate.In order to observe the similarity between these constrained systems, it is crucial to abstract away from the details of the structures and operations used by the system.Although embedding this version of LCFRS's in the framework of ILFP developed by Rounds (1985) is straightforward, our motivation was to capture properties shared by a family of grammatical systems and generalize them defining a class of related formalisms.Thus, as in CFG's, at any point in the derivation, the set of structures that can be applied is determined only by a finite set of rules encapsulated by the grammar.
