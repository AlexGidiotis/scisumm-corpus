Central to our approach is vector composition which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions.Specifically, we present both additive and multiplicative models of vector combination and assess their performance on a sentence similarity rating experiment.Our work proposes a framework for vector composition which allows the derivation of different types of models and licenses two fundamental composition operations, multiplication and addition (and their combination).For additive models, a natural way to achieve this is to include further vectors into the summation.To derive specific models from this general framework requires the identification of appropriate constraints to narrow the space of functions being considered.Although we have presented multiplicative and additive models separately, there is nothing inherent in our formulation that disallows their combination.We formulated composition as a function of two vectors and introduced several models based on addition and multiplication.A more scrupulous evaluation requires directly correlating all the individual participants’ similarity judgments with those of the models.6 We used Spearman’s p for our correlation analyses.As a result of the assumption of symmetry, both these models are ‘bag of words’ models and word order insensitive.
