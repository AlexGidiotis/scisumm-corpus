The first stage based on the unlabeled dependency parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006) augmented with morphological features for a subset of the languages.The second stage takes the output from the first and labels all the edges in the dependency graph with appropriate syntactic categories using a globally trained sequence classifier over components of the graph.Furthermore, it made the system homogeneous in terms of learning algorithms since that is what is used to train our unlabeled parser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).Nivre (2005) gives an introduction to dependency representations of sentences and recent developments in dependency parsing strategies.This system is primarily based on the parsing models described by McDonald and Pereira (2006).In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006).We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.It is our hope that a better morphological feature set will help with both unlabeled parsing and labeling for highly inflected languages.We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.
