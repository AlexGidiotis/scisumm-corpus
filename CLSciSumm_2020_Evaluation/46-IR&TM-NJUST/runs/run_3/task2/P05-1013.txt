The main result is that the combined system can recover non-projective dependencies with a precision sufficient to give a significant improvement in overall parsing accuracy, especially with respect to the exact match criterion, leading to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph, giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence. to non-projective structures.The second main result is that the pseudo-projective approach to parsing (using special arc labels to guide an inverse transformation) gives a further improvement of about one percentage point on attachment score.This may seem surprising, given the experiments reported in section 4, but the explanation is probably that the non-projective dependencies that can be recovered at all are of the simple kind that only requires a single lift, where the encoding of path information is often redundant.The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers.In section 4 we evaluate these transformations with respect to projectivized dependency treebanks, and in section 5 they are applied to parser output.Before we turn to the evaluation, however, we need to introduce the data-driven dependency parser used in the latter experiments.
