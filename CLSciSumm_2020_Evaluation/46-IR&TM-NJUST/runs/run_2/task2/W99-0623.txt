We have developed a general approach for combining parsers when preserving the entire structure of a parse tree is important.The entries in this table can be compared with those of Table 3 to see how the performance of the combining techniques degrades in the presence of an inferior parser.The precision and recall of similarity switching and constituent voting are both significantly better than the best individual parser, and constituent voting is significantly better than parser switching in precision.4 Constituent voting gives the highest accuracy for parsing the Penn Treebank reported to date.The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5% when we added this new parser, but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly.We do not show the numbers for the Bayes models in Table 2 because the parameters involved were established using this set.Since our goal is to perform well under these measures we will similarly treat constituents as the minimal substructures for combination.• Similarly, when the naïve Bayes classifier is configured such that the constituents require estimated probabilities strictly larger than 0.5 to be accepted, there is not enough probability mass remaining on crossing brackets for them to be included in the hypothesis.In Table 1 we see with very few exceptions that the isolated constituent precision is less than 0.5 when we use the constituent label as a feature.
