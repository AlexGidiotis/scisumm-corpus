In fact, for every language our models perform significantly higher than the average performance for all the systems reported in Buchholz et al. (2006).These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.We then add to the representation of the edge: Mi as head features, Mj as dependent features, and also each conjunction of a feature from both sets.That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph.Of course, we have to define a set of suitable features.For the remainder of this paper, we denote by x = x1,... xn a sentence with n words and by y a corresponding dependency graph.For instance, if we consider a head xi with dependents xj1, ... , xjM, it is often the case that many of these dependencies will have correlated labels.
