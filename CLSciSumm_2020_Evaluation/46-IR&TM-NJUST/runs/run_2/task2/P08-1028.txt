As a result of the assumption of symmetry, both these models are ‘bag of words’ models and word order insensitive.In fact, the commonest method for combining the vectors is to average them.To give a concrete example, circular convolution is an instance of the general multiplicative model which breaks this constraint by allowing uj to contribute to pi: For example, according to (5), the addition of the two vectors representing horse and run in Figure 1 would yield horse + run = [1 14 6 14 4].Another simplification concerns K which can be ignored so as to explore what can be achieved in the absence of additional knowledge.For comparison, we also show the human ratings for these items (UpperBound).Model similarities have been estimated using cosine which ranges from 0 to 1, whereas our subjects rated the sentences on a scale from 1 to 7.The neighbors, Kintsch argues, can ‘strengthen features of the predicate that are appropriate for the argument of the predication’. animal stable village gallop jokey horse 0 6 2 10 4 run 1 8 4 4 0 Unfortunately, comparisons across vector composition models have been few and far between in the literature.Figure 3 shows the distribution of estimated similarities under the multiplicative model.
