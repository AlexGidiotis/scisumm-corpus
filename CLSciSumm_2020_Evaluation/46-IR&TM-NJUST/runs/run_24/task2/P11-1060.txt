As in Clarke et al. (2010), we obviate the need for annotated logical forms by considering the endto-end problem of mapping questions to answers.5 Discussion Piantadosi et al. (2008) induces first-order formuA major focus of this work is on our semantic rep- lae using CCG in a small domain assuming observed resentation, DCS, which offers a new perspective lexical semantics.On two stansemantic parsing benchmarks our system obtains the highest published accuracies, despite requiring no annotated logical forms.Results We first compare our system with Clarke et al. (2010) (henceforth, SEMRESP), which also learns a semantic parser from question-answer pairs.We now turn to the task of mapping natural language For the example in Figure 4(b), the de- utterances to DCS trees.All other systems require logical forms as training data, whereas ours does not.Figure 1 shows our probabilistic model: with respect to a world w (database of facts), producing an answer y.Feedback from the context; for example, the lexical entry for borders world has been used to guide both syntactic parsing is S\NP/NP : Ay.Ax.border(x, y), which means (Schuler, 2003) and semantic parsing (Popescu et borders looks right for the first argument and left al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2010).
