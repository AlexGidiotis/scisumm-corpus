In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.We also calculate the WSD accuracy that would be obtained on SemCor, when using our first sense in all contexts ( ).The results for 10 of the words from the qualitative experiment are summarized in table 3 with the WordNet sense number for each word supplied alongside synonyms or hypernyms from WordNet for readability.This is just 5% lower than results using the first sense in the manually labelled SemCor, and we obtain 67% precision on polysemous nouns that are not in SemCor.We compare results using the first sense listed in SemCor, and the first sense according to the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words test data itself.Assuming that one had an accurate WSD system then one could obtain frequency counts for senses and rank them with these counts.For every pair of nouns, where each noun had a total frequency in the triple data of 10 or more, we computed their distributional similarity using the measure given by Lin (1998).Magnini and Cavagli`a (2000) have identified WordNet word senses with particular domains, and this has proven useful for high precision WSD (Magnini et al., 2001); indeed in section 5 we used these domain labels for evaluation.
