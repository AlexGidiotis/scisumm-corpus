The constituent voting and naïve Bayes techniques are equivalent because the parameters learned in the training set did not sufficiently discriminate between the three parsers.The average individual parser accuracy was reduced by more than 5% when we added this new parser, but the precision of the constituent voting technique was the only result that decreased significantly.The precision and recall measures (described in more detail in Section 3) used in evaluating Treebank parsing treat each constituent as a separate entity, a minimal unit of correctness.In general, the lemma of the previous section does not ensure that all the productions in the combined parse are found in the grammars of the member parsers.In Table 1 we see with very few exceptions that the isolated constituent precision is less than 0.5 when we use the constituent label as a feature.The second row is the accuracy of the best of the three parsers.'Under certain conditions the constituent voting and naïve Bayes constituent combination techniques are guaranteed to produce sets of constituents with no crossing brackets.IL+-1Proof: Assume a pair of crossing constituents appears in the output of the constituent voting technique using k parsers.This is the only important case, because otherwise the simple majority combining technique would pick the correct constituent.Precision is the portion of hypothesized constituents that are correct and recall is the portion of the Treebank constituents that are hypothesized.
