This is consistent with the average precision/recall of 86.6% for [5] mentioned above, as the latter was on the test corpus and the former on the development corpus.The results for the new parser as well as for the previous top-three individual parsers on this corpus are given in Figure 1.As the generative model is top-down and we use a standard bottom-up best-first probabilistic chart parser [2,7], we use the chart parser as a first pass to generate candidate possible parses to be evaluated in the second pass by our probabilistic model.As we discuss in more detail in Section 5, several different features in the context surrounding c are useful to include in H: the label, head pre-terminal and head of the parent of c (denoted as lp, tp, hp), the label of c's left sibling (lb for "before"), and the label of the grandparent of c (la).We created a parser based upon the maximumentropy-inspired model of the last section, smoothed using standard deleted interpolation.In keeping with the standard methodology [5, 9,10,15,17], we used the Penn Wall Street Journal tree-bank [16] with sections 2-21 for training, section 23 for testing, and section 24 for development (debugging and tuning).Next we add the less obvious conditioning events noted in our previous discussion of the final model â€” grandparent label lg and left sibling label /b.
