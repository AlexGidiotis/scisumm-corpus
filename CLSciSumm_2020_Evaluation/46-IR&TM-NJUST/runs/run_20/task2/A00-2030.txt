In this paper, we report adapting a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFG-HR) to information extraction.We have demonstrated, at least for one problem, that a lexicalized, probabilistic context-free parser with head rules (LPCFGHR) can be used effectively for information extraction.We evaluated the new approach to information extraction on two of the tasks of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7) and reported in (Marsh, 1998).For the following example, the template relation in Figure 2 was to be generated: "Donald M. Goldstein, a historian at the University of Pittsburgh who helped write..."In these trees, the standard TREEBANK structures are augmented to convey semantic information, that is, entities and relations.Yet, relatively few have embedded one of these algorithms in a task.Nearly all of the work was done by the sentential model; disabling the cross-sentence model entirely reduced our overall F-Score by only 2 points.Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words, as in (Weischedel et al. 1993).Head words, along with their part-of-speech tags and features, are generated for each modifier as soon as the modifier is created.These labels serve to form a continuous chain between the relation and its argument.Further details are discussed in the section Tree Augmentation.
