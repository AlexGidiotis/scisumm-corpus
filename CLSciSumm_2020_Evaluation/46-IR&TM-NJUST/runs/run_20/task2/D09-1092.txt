The internet makes it possible for people all over the world to access documents from different cultures, but readers will not be fluent in this wide variety of languages.In an increasingly connected world, the ability to access documents in many languages has become both a strategic asset and a personally enriching experience.We also do not count morphological variants: the model finds EN “rules” and DE “vorschriften,” but the lexicon contains only “rule” and “vorschrift.” Results remain strong as we increase K. With K = 3, T = 800, 1349 of the 7200 candidate pairs for Spanish appeared in the lexicon. topic in different languages translations of each other?We then use this model to infer topic distributions for each of the 11 documents in each of the held-out document tuples using a method similar to that used to calculate held-out probabilities (Wallach et al., 2009).To demonstrate the wide variation in topics, we calculated the proportion of tokens in each language assigned to each topic.We then add the Cartesian product of these sets for every topic to a set of candidate translations C. We report the number of elements of C that appear in the reference lexica.EN “comitology” and IT lang Topics at P = 0.01 “comitalogia”) that simply were not in the lexica.We preprocessed the data by removing tables, references, images and info-boxes.
