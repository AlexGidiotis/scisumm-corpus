In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.Sentences annotated in previous steps are used as training material for further processing.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).This requirement speaks against the traditional sort of dependency trees, in which heads a,re represented as non-terminal nodes, cf.We distinguish five degrees of automation: So far, about 1100 sentences of our corpus have been annotated.Argument structure can be represented in terms of unordered trees (with crossing branches).Owing to the partial automation, the average annotation efficiency improves by 25% (from around 4 minutes to 3 minutes per sentence).
