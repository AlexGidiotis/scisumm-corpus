In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).Nevertheless, since many systems performed well on the English all-words task for SENSEVAL-2 by using the frequency information in SemCor this is a reasonable approach for evaluation.We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task.In order to see how well the automatically acquired predominant sense performs on a WSD task from which the WordNet sense ordering has not been taken, we use the SENSEVAL-2 all-words data (Palmer et al., 2001).To find the first sense of a word ( ) we take each sense in turn and obtain a score reflecting the prevalence which is used for ranking.We are currently investigating the performance of the first sense heuristic, and this method, for other PoS on SENSEVAL-3 data (McCarthy et al., 2004), although not yet with rankings from domain specific corpora.We do not assume that the predominant sense is a method of WSD in itself.More importantly, when working within a specific domain one would wish to tune the first sense heuristic to the domain at hand.Assuming that one had an accurate WSD system then one could obtain frequency counts for senses and rank them with these counts.
