We report results on the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz et al., 2006) data sets and present an error analysis.These results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages.We have presented results showing that the spanning tree dependency parsing framework of McDonald et al. (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald and Pereira, 2006) generalizes well to languages other than English.We use the MIRA online learner to set the weights (Crammer and Singer, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005a) since we found it trained quickly and provide good performance.Its power lies in the ability to define a rich set of features over parsing decisions, as well as surface level features relative to these decisions.That work extends the maximum spanning tree dependency parsing framework (McDonald et al., 2005a; McDonald et al., 2005b) to incorporate features over multiple edges in the dependency graph.For instance, if we consider a head xi with dependents xj1, ... , xjM, it is often the case that many of these dependencies will have correlated labels.That system uses MIRA, an online large-margin learning algorithm, to compute model parameters.
