Since the requirements for such a formalism differ from those posited for configurational languages, several features have been added, influencing the architecture of the scheme.As the need for certain functionalities becomes obvious with growing annotation experience, we have decided to implement the tool in two stages.In general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.In the second phase of the project Verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 German spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of English and Japanese sentences will be created.These differences can be illustrated by a comparison with the Penn Treebank annotation scheme.For evaluation, the already annotated sentences were divided into two disjoint sets, one for training (90% of the corpus), the other one for testing (10%).During the second annotation stage, the annotation is enriched with information about thematic roles, quantifier scope and anaphoric reference.Owing to the partial automation, the average annotation efficiency improves by 25% (from around 4 minutes to 3 minutes per sentence).
