In addition, the restricted version of CG's (discussed in Section 6) generates tree sets with independent paths and we hope that it can be included in a more general definition of LCFRS's containing formalisms whose tree sets have path sets that are themselves LCFRL's (as in the case of the restricted indexed grammars, and the hierarchy defined by Weir).LCFRS's have only been loosely defined in this paper; we have yet to provide a complete set of formal properties associated with members of this class.This class of formalisms have the properties that their derivation trees are local sets, and manipulate objects, using a finite number of composition operations that use a finite number of symbols.We loosely describe the class of all such systems as Linear Context-Free Rewriting Formalisms.We now turn our attention to the recognition of string languages generated by these formalisms (LCFRL's).We would like to relax somewhat the constraint on the path complexity of formalisms in LCFRS.Members of LCFRS whose operations have this property can be translated into the ILFP notation (Rounds, 1985).It has been shown in (Chandra et al., 1981) that if M works in space log n then there is a deterministic TM which accepts the same language in polynomial time.He also argues that paired English complementizers may also require structural descriptions whose path sets have nested dependencies.When 7' is adjoined at ?I in the tree 7 we obtain a tree v".
