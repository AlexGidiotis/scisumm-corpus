We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures.In this paper, we show how non-projective dependency parsing can be achieved by combining a datadriven projective parser with special graph transformation techniques.In order to realize the full potential of dependency-based syntactic parsing, it is desirable to allow non-projective dependency structures.We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques.This leads to the best reported performance for robust non-projective parsing of Czech.Table 5 shows the overall parsing accuracy attained with the three different encoding schemes, compared to the baseline (no special arc labels) and to training directly on non-projective dependency graphs.When the parser is trained on the transformed data, it will ideally learn not only to construct projective dependency structures but also to assign arc labels that encode information about lifts.By applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, arcs with non-standard labels can be lowered to their proper place in the dependency graph, giving rise 1The dependency graph has been modified to make the final period a dependent of the main verb instead of being a dependent of a special root node for the sentence. to non-projective structures.
