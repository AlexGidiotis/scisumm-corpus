In this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.Lapata and Brew obtain their priors for verb classes directly from subcategorisation evidence in a parsed corpus, whereas we use parsed data to find distributionally similar words (nearest neighbours) to the target word which reflect the different senses of the word and have associated distributional similarity scores which can be used for ranking the senses according to prevalence.Whilst we have used WordNet as our sense inventory, it would be possible to use this method with another inventory given a measure of semantic relatedness between the neighbours and the senses.However, the most accurate WSD systems are those which require manually sense tagged data in the first place, and their accuracy depends on the quantity of training examples (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002) available.In order to find the predominant sense of a target word we use a thesaurus acquired from automatically parsed text based on the method of Lin (1998).Nevertheless, since many systems performed well on the English all-words task for SENSEVAL-2 by using the frequency information in SemCor this is a reasonable approach for evaluation.We obtained the predominant sense for each of these words and used these to label the instances in the noun data within the SENSEVAL-2 English allwords task.
