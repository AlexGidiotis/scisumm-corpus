Morphological segmentation decisions in our model are delegated to a lexeme-based PCFG and we show that using a simple treebank grammar, a data-driven lexicon, and a linguistically motivated unknown-tokens handling our model outperforms (Tsarfaty, 2006) and (Cohen and Smith, 2007) on the joint task and achieves state-of-the-art results on a par with current respective standalone models.2Tsarfaty (2006) argues that for Semitic languages determining the correct morphological segmentation is dependent on syntactic context and shows that increasing information sharing between the morphological and the syntactic components leads to improved performance on the joint task.Evaluating parsing results in our joint framework, as argued by Tsarfaty (2006), is not trivial under the joint disambiguation task, as the hypothesized yield need not coincide with the correct one.Cohen and Smith (2007) followed up on these results and proposed a system for joint inference of morphological and syntactic structures using factored models each designed and trained on its own.Secondly, for all our models we provide better fine- and coarse-grained POS-tagging accuracy, and all pruned models outperform the Oracle results reported by them.12 In terms of syntactic disambiguation, even the simplest grammar pruned with HSPELL outperforms their non-Oracle results.The input for the segmentation task is however highly ambiguous for Semitic languages, and surface forms (tokens) may admit multiple possible analyses as in (BarHaim et al., 2007; Adler and Elhadad, 2006).Tsarfaty (2006) was the first to demonstrate that fully automatic Hebrew parsing is feasible using the newly available 5000 sentences treebank.
