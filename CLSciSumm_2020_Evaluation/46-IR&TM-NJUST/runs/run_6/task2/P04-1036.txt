We have devised a method that uses raw corpus data to automatically find a predominant sense for nouns in WordNet.We are of course able to apply the method to other versions of WordNet. synset, is incremented with the frequency counts from the corpus of all words belonging to that synset, directly or via the hyponymy relation.In this work the lists of neighbours are themselves clustered to bring out the various senses of the word.Since SemCor is derived from the Brown corpus, which predates the BNC by up to 30 years 5 and contains a higher proportion of fiction 6, the high ranking for the tobacco pipe sense according to SemCor seems plausible.We experimented using six of these to provide the in equation 1 above and obtained results well over our baseline, but because of space limitations give results for the two which perform the best.The results in table 1 show the accuracy of the ranking with respect to SemCor over the entire set of 2595 polysemous nouns in SemCor with the jcn and lesk WordNet similarity measures.This is shown by the results of the English all-words task in SENSEVAL-2 (Cotton et al., 1998) in figure 1 below, where the first sense is that listed in WordNet for the PoS given by the Penn TreeBank (Palmer et al., 2001).The senses in WordNet are ordered according to the frequency data in the manually tagged resource SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).
