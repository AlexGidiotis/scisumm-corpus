In order to observe the similarity between these constrained systems, it is crucial to abstract away from the details of the structures and operations used by the system.In considering recognition of LCFRS's, we make further assumption concerning the contribution of each structure to the input string, and how the composition operations combine structures in this respect.Unlike GCFG's, however, the composition operations of LCFRS's are restricted to be linear (do not duplicate unboundedly large structures) and nonerasing (do not erase unbounded structures, a restriction made in most modern transformational grammars).Like HG's, TAG's, and MCTAG's, members of LCFRS can manipulate structures more complex than terminal strings and use composition operations that are more complex that concatenation.The space of a configuration is the sum of the lengths of the nonblank tape contents of the k work tapes.An extension of the TAG system was introduced by Joshi et al. (1975) and later redefined by Joshi (1987) in which the adjunction operation is defined on sets of elementary trees rather than single trees.Thus, the length of any string in L is a linear combination of the length of strings in some fixed finite subset of L, and thus L is said to have the constant growth property.There has been recent interest in the application of Indexed Grammars (IG's) to natural languages.These systems are similar to those described by Pollard (1984) as Generalized Context-Free Grammars (GCFG's).
