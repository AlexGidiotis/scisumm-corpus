Two apparently opposing DOP models exist in the literature: one which computes the parse tree involving the most frequent subtrees from a treebank and one which computes the parse tree involving the fewest subtrees from a treebank.As to the processing time, the PCFG reduction parses each sentence 100 words) in 3.6 seconds average, while the parser in Bod (2001, 2003), which uses over 5 million subtrees, is reported to take about 220 seconds per sentence.DOP1 combines subtrees from a treebank by means of node-substitution and computes the probability of a tree from the normalized frequencies of the subtrees (see Section 2 for a full definition).Compared to Bod (2001), our results show an 11% improvement in terms of relative error reduction and a speedup which reduces the processing time from 220 to 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.While Bod (2001) needed to use a very large sample from the WSJ subtrees to do this, Goodman's method can do the same job with a more compact grammar.We will refer to these models as Likelihood-DOP models, but in this paper we will specifically mean by "Likelihood-DOP" the PCFG-reduction of Bod (2001) given in Section 2.2.
