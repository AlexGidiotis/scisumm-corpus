These two restrictions impose the constraint that the result of composing any two structures should be a structure whose "size" is the sum of its constituents plus some constant For example, the operation 4, discussed in the case of CFG's (in Section 4.1) adds the constant equal to the sum of the length of the strings VI, un+râ€¢ Since we are considering formalisms with arbitrary structures it is difficult to precisely specify all of the restrictions on the composition operations that we believe would appropriately generalize the concatenation operation for the particular structures used by the formalism.In the next section, we show how an ATM can accept the strings generated by a grammar in a LCFRS formalism in logspace, and hence show that each family can be recognized in polynomial time.In the remainder of the paper, we outline how a class of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS's) may be defined and sketch how semilinearity and polynomial recognition of these systems follows.As in the case of the derivation trees of CFG's, nodes are labeled by a member of some finite set of symbols (perhaps only implicit in the grammar as in TAG's) used to denote derived structures.From the discussion so far it is clear that a number of formalisms involve some type of context-free rewriting (they have derivation trees that are local sets).
