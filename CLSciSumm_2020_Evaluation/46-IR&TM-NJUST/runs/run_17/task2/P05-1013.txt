We show how a datadriven deterministic dependency parser, in itself restricted to projective structures, can be combined with graph transformation techniques to produce non-projective structures.We have presented a new method for non-projective dependency parsing, based on a combination of data-driven projective dependency parsing and graph transformation techniques.Table 5 shows the overall parsing accuracy attained with the three different encoding schemes, compared to the baseline (no special arc labels) and to training directly on non-projective dependency graphs.When the parser is trained on the transformed data, it will ideally learn not only to construct projective dependency structures but also to assign arc labels that encode information about lifts.On the other hand, given that all schemes have similar parsing accuracy overall, this means that the Path scheme is the least likely to introduce errors on projective arcs.The second main result is that the pseudo-projective approach to parsing (using special arc labels to guide an inverse transformation) gives a further improvement of about one percentage point on attachment score.The overall parsing accuracy obtained with the pseudo-projective approach is still lower than for the best projective parsers.However, this argument is only plausible if the formal framework allows non-projective dependency structures, i.e. structures where a head and its dependents may correspond to a discontinuous constituent.
