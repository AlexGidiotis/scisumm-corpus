Together with a PCFGreduction of DOP we obtain improved accuracy and efficiency on the Wall Street Journal treebank Our results show an 11% relative reduction in error rate over previous models, and an average processing time of 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.Collins & Duffy (2002) showed how the perceptron algorithm can be used to efficiently compute the best parse with DOP1's subtrees, reporting a 5.1% relative reduction in error rate over the model in Collins (1999) on the WSJ.In this paper, we will test a simple extension of Goodman's compact PCFG-reduction of DOP which has the same property as the normalization proposed in Bod (2001) in that it assigns roughly equal weight to each node in the training data.Bod reports state-of-the-art results with this method, and observes no decrease in parse accuracy when larger subtrees are included (using subtrees up to depth 14).As to the processing time, the PCFG reduction parses each sentence 100 words) in 3.6 seconds average, while the parser in Bod (2001, 2003), which uses over 5 million subtrees, is reported to take about 220 seconds per sentence.Compared to Bod (2001), our results show an 11% improvement in terms of relative error reduction and a speedup which reduces the processing time from 220 to 3.6 seconds per WSJ sentence.
