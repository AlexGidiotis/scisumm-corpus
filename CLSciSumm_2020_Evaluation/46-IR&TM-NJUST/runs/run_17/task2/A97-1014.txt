As theory-independence is one of our objectives, the annotation scheme incorporates a number of widely accepted linguistic analyses, especially in the area of verbal, adverbial and adjectival syntax.The difference between the particular NK's lies in the positional and part-of-speech information, which is also sufficient to recover theory-specific structures from our `underspecified' representations.We have argued that the selected approach is better suited for producing high quality interpreted corpora in languages exhibiting free constituent order.The following commands are available: The three tagsets used by the annotation tool (for words, phrases, and edges) are variable and are stored together with the corpus.We will closely coordinate the further development of our corpus with the annotation work in Verbmobil and with other German efforts in corpus annotation.In order to avoid inconsistencies, the corpus is annotated in two stages: basic annotation and nfirtellte714.Due to the substantial differences between existing models of constituent structure, the question arises of how the theory independencf requirement, can be satisfied.As modern linguistics is also becoming more aware of the importance of larger sets of naturally occurring data., interpreted corpora. are a. valuable resource for theoretical and descriptive linguistic research.In addition, we have adopted a simple convention for those cases in which context information is insufficient, for total disambiguation: the highest possible attachment, site is chosen.In section 2, we examine the appropriateness of existing annotation schemes.
