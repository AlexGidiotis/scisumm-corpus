in general, the resulting interpreted data also are closer to semantic annotation and more neutral with respect to particular syntactic theories.
however, some other standard analysts turn out to be problematic, mainly due to the partial, idealised character of competence grammars, which often marginalise or ignore such important. phenomena. as 'deficient' (e.g. headless) constructions, appositions, temporal expressions, etc.
the following features of our formalism are then of particular importance: the current tagset comprises only 16 node labels and 34 function tags, yet a. finely grinned classification will take place in the near future.

consider the german sentence (1) daran wird ihn anna erkennen, &di er weint at-it will him anna recognise that he cries 'anna will recognise him at his cry' a sample constituent structure is given below: the fairly short sentence contains three non-local dependencies, marked by co-references between traces and the corresponding nodes.
accuracy of the unreliable 10% of assignments is 75%, i.e., the annotator has to alter the choice in 1 of 4 cases when asked for confirmation.
in the second phase of the project verbmobil a. treebank for :30,000 german spoken sentences as well as for the same amount of english and japanese sentences will be created.
we distinguish the following levels of representation: 'a context-free constituent backbone can still be recovered from the surface string and argument structure by reattaching 'extracted' structures to a higher node.
