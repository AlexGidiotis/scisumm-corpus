2 segmentation and pos tagging given a chinese character sequence: while the segmentation and pos tagging result can be depicted as: here, ci (i = l.n) denotes chinese character, ti (i = l.m) denotes pos tag, and cl:r (l < r) denotes character sequence ranges from cl to cr.
on the penn chinese treebank 5.0, we obtain an error reduction of segmentation and joint segmentation and part-of-speech tagging over the perceptron-only baseline.
the second was conducted on the penn chinese treebank 5.0 (ctb5.0) to test the performance of the cascaded model on segmentation and joint s&t.
to compare with others conveniently, we excluded the ones forbidden by the close test regulation of sighan, for example, pu(c0), indicating whether character c0 is a punctuation.
the authors were supported by national natural science foundation of china, contracts 60736014 and 60573188, and 863 state key project no.
we called them non-lexical-target because predications derived from them can predicate without considering the current character c0.
finally, the word count penalty gives improvement to the cascaded model, 0.13 points on segmentation and 0.16 points on joint s&t.
test results listed in table 2 shows that this model obtains higher accuracy than the best of sighan bakeoff 2 in three corpora (as, cityu and msr).
in order to inspect how much improvement each feature brings into the cascaded model, every time we removed a feature while retaining others, then retrained the model and tested its performance on the test set.
templates immediately borrowed from ng and low (2004) are listed in the upper column named non-lexical-target.
