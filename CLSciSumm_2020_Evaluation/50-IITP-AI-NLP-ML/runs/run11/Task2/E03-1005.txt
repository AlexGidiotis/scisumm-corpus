thus the major innovations of dop are: 2. the use of arbitrarily large fragments rather than restricted ones both have gained or are gaining wide usage, and are also becoming relevant for theoretical linguistics (see bod et al. 2003a).
the derivation with the smallest sum, or highest rank, is taken as the final best derivation producing the best parse tree in simplicity-dop.3 although bod (2000b) reports that simplicity dop is outperformed by likelihood-dop, its results are still rather impressive for such a simple model.
goodman then shows by simple induction that subderivations headed by a with external nonterminals at the roots and leaves, internal nonterminals elsewhere have probability 1/a.
although bod's method obtains very competitive results on the wall street journal (wsj) task, the parsing time was reported to be over 200 seconds per sentence (bod 2003).
johnson (1998b, 2002) showed that dop1's subtree estimation method is statistically biased and inconsistent.
in bod (2000b), an alternative notion for the best parse tree was proposed based on a simplicity criterion: instead of producing the most probable tree, this model produced the tree generated by the shortest derivation with the fewest training subtrees.
this paper showed that a pcfg-reduction of dop in combination with a new notion of the best parse tree results in fast processing times and very competitive accuracy on the wall street journal treebank.
note that goodman's pcfg-reduction method summarized in section 2 applies not only to likelihood-dop but also to simplicity-dop.
compared to the reranking technique in collins (2000), who obtained an lp of 89.9% and an lr of 89.6%, our results show a 9% relative error rate reduction.
