the first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised wsd systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account.
whilst a first sense heuristic based on a sense-tagged corpus such as semcor is clearly useful, there is a strong case for obtaining a first, or predominant, sense from untagged corpus data so that a wsd system can be tuned to the genre or domain at hand.
in this paper we describe and evaluate a method for ranking senses of nouns to obtain the predominant sense of a word using the neighbours from automatically acquired thesauruses.
for the experiments in sections 3 and 4 we used the 90 million words of written english from the bnc.
this work was funded by eu-2001-34460 project meaning: developing multilingual web-scale language technologies, uk epsrc project robust accurate statistical parsing (rasp) and a uk epsrc studentship.
we then use the wordnet similarity package (patwardhan and pedersen, 2003) to give us a semantic similarity measure (hereafter referred to as the wordnet similarity measure) to weight the contribution that each neighbour makes to the various senses of the target word.
for example, the neighbours of star in a dependency-based thesaurus provided by lin 1 has the ordered list of neighbours: superstar, player, teammate, actor early in the list, but one can also see words that are related to another sense of star e.g. galaxy, sun, world and planet further down the list.
we use the wordnet similarity package 0.05 and wordnet version 1.6.
our automatically acquired predominant sense performs nearly as well as the first sense provided by semcor, which is very encouraging given that our method only uses raw text, with no manual labelling.
