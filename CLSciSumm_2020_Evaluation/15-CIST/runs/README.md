The folder `system run` contains all the runs of our method. In task1, there are 4 methods for task1A and 7 methods for task1B. And we use 3 methods in task2. So the `system run` folder includes 84 runs, named run1, run2,...,run84. The folder format of each run as follows:
run1 (directory)
  -Task1 (directory)
    A00-2018.csv, A00-2030.csv, ...
  -Task2 (directory)
    A00-2018.txt, A00-2030.txt, ...

Please refer to `readme.csv` to get more information about what method corresponds to each run.
